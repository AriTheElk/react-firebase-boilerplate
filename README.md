The React Firebase Boilerplate was originally based on the [react-hot-redux-firebase-starter](https://github.com/douglascorrea/react-hot-redux-firebase-starter). The structure was changed durastically when creating this, so I decided to start an entirely new boilerplate based off the fork.

## Usage Guide

### Boilerplate Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/jsbros/react-firebase-boilerplate
cd react-firebase-boilerplate
npm install
```

### Firebase setup

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), if you don't already have one.
  - If you already have an existing Google project associated with your app, click `Import Google Project`. Otherwise, click `Create New Project`.
  - If you already have a Firebase project, click `Add App` from the project overview page.
2. Click `Add Firebase to your web app`.
3. Copy all the values keys in the `config` object over to the [config/firebase.js](config/firebase.js) file.
4.  [Register your app](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) as a developer application on GitHub and get your app's OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret.
5. Enable GitHub authentication:
  1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), open the `Auth` section.
  2. On the `Sign in method` tab, enable the `GitHub` sign-in method and specify the OAuth 2.0 `Client ID` and `Client Secret` you got from GitHub.
  3. Then, make sure your Firebase `OAuth redirect URI` (e.g. `my-app-12345.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler`) is set as your `Authorization callback URL` in your app's settings page on your [GitHub app's config](https://github.com/settings/developers).


### Usage

```
npm start
```

## Development Tasks

- `npm start` run the web app with lint and tests in watch mode
- `npm run lint` linting javascript code usig eslint
- `npm run test` test using mocha and enzyme

### Code Linting

All code must pass the linter 100% before getting merged into the master repo. It's highly recommended to install an eslint extension into your code editor/IDE. You can also run the linter from the command line using

```
npm run lint
```

### Commit Styles

All commit messages must follow the [Semantic Commit Message](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages) guidelines.
